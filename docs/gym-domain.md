# Gym domain layer

> Read this before touching members, plans, memberships, billing, payments, auto-pay, or attendance.

**A member = a `contacts` row that also has a `memberships` row.** (Leads = contacts that anti-join memberships.) Core tables land in migration `031_gym_memberships.sql`; the model was extended by `057` (billing periods), `058` + `20260711173414` (payments hardening), `059`/`060` (UPI AutoPay), `061` (mid-cycle plan change), `062` (plan types + pricing options), `063` (attendance usage RPC + plan-type lock).

All date math is **account-timezone-first** (`src/lib/memberships/expiry.ts`) — a member must not expire a day early/late. "Expired" is **derived at read time**, never a stored status.

---

## Plans

### `membership_plans` (restructured by `062`, PushPress-style)

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `plan_type` | `recurring` = billing cycles + renewal chase + autopay · `non_recurring` = fixed term, pay once, **excluded from renewal reminders/action lists** · `session_pack` = punchcard |
| `attendance_limit_count` / `_interval` | visit cap (`'period'` \| `'week'` \| `'month'`); NULL = unlimited |
| `sessions_count` | pack size |
| `is_active` | soft-archive (FK RESTRICT) |
| ~~`price`~~ / ~~`duration_days`~~ | **LEGACY-FROZEN.** Pricing lives on the child table. The settings UI mirrors the first option into them (for rollback + the autopay day-snap fallback only). **New code must not read them.** |

`plan_type` is **DB-locked once memberships reference the plan** (`063` trigger `lock_live_plan_type`, mirroring the editor's UI lock). Settings-class RLS (admin write).

### `plan_pricing_options` (`062`)

One row per **billing option** a plan sells: `duration_count × duration_unit ('day'|'week'|'month'|'year')`, `price`, one-time `setup_fee`, `is_active`, `sort_order`. One "Gold" plan carries monthly/quarterly/yearly rows.

- **`setup_fee` is no longer editable** — the plan editor sells duration × price only. The column and every consumer stay, so a legacy/backfilled fee still bills and renders, and the editor round-trips it untouched rather than zeroing it.
- **`setup_fee` folds into the FIRST cycle's `fee_amount` only.** Renewals, plan changes, and CSV import bill `price` alone.
- **Durations are calendar-accurate.** TS `addDuration()` (`expiry.ts`, end-of-month clamp: Jan 31 + 1mo = Feb 28) mirrors SQL `date + count * INTERVAL '1 <unit>'`.

### Pure helpers (never inline this math)

- `src/lib/memberships/pricing.ts` — `activeOptions` / `defaultOption` (first active by sort = the no-picker/CSV rule), `optionEndDate`, `firstCycleFee`, `renewalFee`, `durationLabel`.
- **`isRenewalChaseable(plan)`** (`pricing.ts`, tested) is the named predicate for "chased for renewal?" — recurring, or a legacy-NULL plan. Used by the cron, the Renewals lists, `canSetupAutoPay`, and the mandate route. **Never inline-compare `plan_type` for this.**
- `src/lib/memberships/attendance-limits.ts` — `membershipUsageWindowStart`, `attendanceUsage`, `sessionsRemaining`, `checkInWarning`, `usageSummary` (the shared usage line both check-in surfaces render).
- `src/lib/memberships/check-in.ts` — Supabase orchestration: `fetchCheckInUsage` (fresh count + warning), `fetchUsageCounts` (batched per-window counts via the `063` `attendance_usage_counts` RPC). **Never inline the count query in a component.**
- `src/lib/memberships/plan-change.ts` — `planChangeQuote` (tested).
- `src/lib/memberships/filters.ts` — `applyMemberFilters` (tested), shared by the members table / select-all-matching / CSV export. **"Expired" is derived**, so its predicate is `status='active' AND end_date < today` — never `.eq('status','expired')`.

### Plan editor UI

`plans-settings.tsx` (list) + `plan-editor-dialog.tsx`. Type = three always-open `RadioGroup` cards at the top, then name, then description. All pricing rows + the add-row button live in ONE bordered container (row = duration count+unit over a `CurrencyInput` price). Visit limit = a `Checkbox` (default OFF = unlimited) revealing count+interval via `Collapse`.

**Copy is per plan type — `PLAN_COPY`.** The same `duration_count × duration_unit` column means a different thing per type, so the labels must too:

| Type | Section | Duration label | Add button |
|---|---|---|---|
| recurring | Billing options | Bill every | Add billing option |
| non_recurring | Pricing & expiry | **Expire plan in** | Add another price |
| session_pack | Pricing & validity | Valid for | Add another price |

The repeater stays on **all three** (PushPress sells several terms under one fixed-term plan too). The visit-limit `period` interval reads "per term" on a fixed-term plan (`limitIntervals(planType)`). Before this, fixed-term shared the recurring branch and told the owner a never-billing plan "bills every 1 month". **Any new type-facing string goes in `PLAN_COPY`** — never a `session_pack ? … : …` split at a call-site.

**Canonical picker: `PlanOptionPicker`** (`components/members/plan-option-picker.tsx`) — plan Select + conditional option Select, labelled per type via `OPTION_LABEL` (Billing option / Term / Pricing), single option auto-selects, trial sentinel + required star + footer slots. Mounted in member-form, renew, change-plan, import-members. (Bulk-convert keeps its DropdownMenu style with an option submenu.)

---

## Memberships

`memberships` — one per member (`UNIQUE(account_id, contact_id)`):

**`member_number`** (account-wide Member ID; DB-assigned from 1001, immutable, never reused, and deliberately not branch-scoped) · `plan_id` · **`pricing_option_id`** (FK RESTRICT, `062`; the renew/edit/change RPCs keep it in sync and validate option↔plan; NULL on legacy/trial rows) · `start_date` · `end_date` (the hot column) · `status` (`active`/`frozen`/`cancelled`; **expired is derived**) · `fee_amount` · `fee_status` (`paid`/`due` — **derived by DB trigger from the ledger, never written by clients**) · `frozen_at` · `collection_mode` (`manual`/`auto`).

**Member ID (`20260721120000`):** uniqueness is `(account_id, member_number)`, so separate tenants may both have `1001`. The private `account_member_number_counters` row serializes every membership insert—including imports and conversions—and is never decremented on deletion. A future branch belongs beneath the account: moving/visiting branches must not change the Member ID; attendance may gain `branch_id`/`device_id` separately. Treat Member ID as an identifier, never an authentication secret.

Operational RLS (agent write). Renewals mutate in place — the row is the **current-cycle pointer**.

**Lead conversion (`20260721130000`):** the seeded conversion form uses one split screen. Its left rail supports the same click-to-edit contact behavior as the lead sheet, profile-photo editing through the shared avatar dialog, Birthday and account-configured Gender capture, and localized height/weight capture; edits persist to the existing contact immediately. The right side keeps plan, billing-option expiry, discount, and collection decisions together. Conversion may apply one fixed-amount or percentage discount to the initial invoice. `memberships.conversion_list_price` plus the `conversion_discount_*` columns retain the originating offer; the birth trigger copies it to `membership_periods.list_price` / `discount_*`, and `membership_period_invoices` exposes the breakdown. The membership's first `fee_amount` is the discounted net total. Every later manual or auto renewal still bills `plan_pricing_options.price`, so the offer never recurs. Quote and validation math lives in `src/lib/memberships/discount.ts`; do not reimplement it in a component.

---

## Billing periods = invoices (`057`)

`membership_periods` — **one row per billing cycle = one invoice**: `period_start/end`, `fee_amount` snapshot, `state: open|void`, `pricing_option_id`, `UNIQUE(membership_id, period_end)`.

The `memberships` row stays the current-cycle pointer (its start/end/fee mirror the live cycle, so every pre-existing read keeps working); periods accumulate the HISTORY, giving recurring members a real Paid/Unpaid/Upcoming trail + arrears.

**View `membership_period_invoices`** adds `amount_paid` / `balance` by reconciling payments on `period_end` (same trick as `membership_dues` — so there is **no `period_id` on payments**).

**Status is derived in TS**, not SQL — it needs the account's tz "today", so the view stays tz-agnostic. `periodStatus()` in `src/lib/memberships/periods.ts`.

### Lifecycle — who creates/moves a period

| Op | Path |
|---|---|
| membership created (any of 5 paths) | `AFTER INSERT` trigger `create_initial_membership_period` → **zero TS needed** |
| renew / convert | RPC `renew_membership_transaction` |
| mid-cycle plan swap / upgrade | RPC `change_membership_plan` (`061`) |
| edit cycle / unfreeze / cancel / reactivate | RPCs `edit_membership_cycle` / `unfreeze_membership` / `set_membership_cancellation` (`058`) — thin TS wrappers in `periods.ts` |
| freeze | the one remaining direct membership write — still chains `.select('id')` |

A trigger can't tell a renewal from an edit from an unfreeze — hence the RPCs, each ONE transaction. Lifecycle RPCs raise **real errors** (no silent-RLS ambiguity).

**Renew opens a NEW period; the old one stays = arrears.** Settling an old arrears invoice records against **that** period (`RecordPaymentDialog` takes an optional `period` prop) and does **not** touch the membership's live `fee_status`.

### ⚠️ Reconcile-key gotcha (load-bearing)

Payments ↔ periods join **only on `period_end`**. Any op that moves a cycle's `period_end` (an unfreeze pushes it by the frozen days; an edit can shift it) **MUST re-stamp that cycle's existing payments to the new key** — otherwise they orphan and a paid cycle reads Unpaid.

The `058` RPCs do this INSIDE the same transaction. `payments.period_start` / `period_end` / `plan_id` are **protected financial fields**: a direct agent update is rejected by `protect_payment_financial_fields`, so the RPCs (via the tx-local GUC `app.allow_payment_restamp`) are the only re-stamp path besides an admin. A shared "sync period" SQL helper callable by `authenticated` would re-open the forge — **the sync logic is deliberately inlined per-RPC.**

### Upcoming invoice

The single *next* invoice is **projected in TS** (`projectNextInvoice`) — display-only, it can't be real until it happens. It returns null for a lapsed membership (`end_date <= today`) so an expired member never shows a phantom past-dated "Unpaid" projection. Past + current periods are persisted.

`InvoiceDetailDialog` reads the view's `amount_paid` (not `fee − balance`) so an over-paid cycle's total is honest.

### ⚠️ Display-precision money rule (non-negotiable)

`formatCurrency` renders **0 fraction digits**, so any amount below half a currency unit prints as `₹0`. A mid-cycle plan change routinely leaves such a residue (it re-invoices the truncated cycle at its pro-rated used value — a one-day stub bills ₹0.32). A raw `balance > 0` test therefore put a **"Due" pill on a row reading ₹0 / ₹0 / ₹0**, and the money is unchaseable anyway (the ledger's ≤-balance guard rejects even a ₹1 payment against it).

**Every money judgement goes through `isChargeableAmount(amount)`** (`periods.ts`, `SETTLED_BALANCE_EPSILON = 0.5`). **Never `> 0` / `<= 0` on a fee or balance again.** The same epsilon gates `isCollectiblePeriod`, the Record-payment / Copy-UPI affordances, the member card's "₹x due" chip, the payment-due buckets, and bulk record-payment.

An invoice's **payment axis** is orthogonal to its Current/Past/Upcoming/Void lifecycle: pure `invoicePaymentState()` → `paid | due | no_charge`, rendered by `InvoicePaymentBadge`. **No charge** (neutral) = the cycle billed AND collected nothing (a zero-fee cycle, or a stub whose fee rounds to zero) — neither Paid (no money moved) nor Due (nothing owed). A stub that DID collect money still reads Paid. `periodStatus()` delegates to it.

---

## Payments ledger

`payments` — **append-only**: `amount`, `method` (cash/upi/card/bank/other), `paid_at`, `period_start/end`, `screenshot_url/path`, `user_id` (**nullable** — auto-pay rows have no human recorder; render "Auto-pay"), `source` (`manual`|`auto`), `mandate_id`, `gateway_payment_id` (`UNIQUE(account_id, gateway_payment_id)` = retry-safe).

Hardened by `20260711173414` + `058` — the ledger is DB-authoritative and tamper-resistant:

- **`fee_status` is derived by triggers** (`derive_membership_fee_status`, `refresh_…`) — never written by a client.
- Every INSERT is validated by `validate_membership_payment`: real open period, amount > 0, ≤ outstanding balance, agent access.
- Idempotent transactional RPCs: `record_membership_payment` · `renew_membership_transaction` · `void_membership_payment` (admin-only, reasoned; **append-preserving** — status `void` + `voided_at/by/reason`; UI = `VoidPaymentDialog` + `VoidedPaymentBadge` tooltip) · `delete_member` (ledger survives — payment FKs are SET NULL).
- **Receipts live in the PRIVATE `payment-receipts` bucket** — `uploadPrivateAccountMedia`, viewed via signed URL (`PaymentProofLink` re-signs after 4 min). **Never persist a signed URL.** Storage DELETE: agents only for objects unreferenced by a payment row (staged uploads); admins any.
- `membership_periods` DELETE is admin-only.
- Error toasts → `getErrorMessage` (`src/lib/errors.ts`).

**Reconciliation UX:** every payment row shows who recorded it (`payments.user_id` → `useAccountStaff`). `payments-ledger.tsx` has per-method collected totals (voids excluded) + CSV export + a "latest 100" truncation notice. `InvoiceDetailDialog` offers Copy-UPI for an arrears balance. `RecordPaymentDialog` has Full/Half chips + live "remaining after this payment"; both record dialogs cap `paid_on` at today. Bulk record shows a per-member name→balance preview and names failures in the toast.

---

## Mid-cycle plan change (`061`)

Member sheet → Membership `⋯` → **Change plan** (first item; active + non-trial only — trials keep Convert, frozen must resume first).

`ChangePlanDialog`: pick the new plan + switch date (min = day after the current cycle starts), see the credit quote live. Unused **paid** days of the current cycle come back as a credit against the new plan's fee:

```
usedValue = fee × used/total
credit    = max(0, paid − usedValue)
netFee    = max(0, price − credit)
```

(`planChangeQuote`, pure + tested; degenerate inputs quote as fully-used = zero credit. Fee + collect amount follow the quote until touched — the member-form `feeTouched` idiom.)

Commit = RPC `change_membership_plan` — one transaction, `membership_operations` idempotency op `'plan_change'`: truncate the current period at the switch date → re-invoice it at `oldCycleFee = usedValue` → re-stamp its payments under the `058` GUC → open the new plan's period → roll the pointer → optionally record the first collection. A paid cycle then reads as **over-paid by exactly the credit** (honest, via the view's `amount_paid`); an unpaid one keeps arrears for used days only. The old cycle's fee is capped at its original fee (truncation can't inflate it). Period-end collisions raise friendly errors. Switching on/after the old expiry skips truncation (plain succession).

"Edit membership" stays for corrections.

---

## Attendance & limits

- **Session-pack remaining is DERIVED** (`sessions_count` − attendance count since current cycle start, keyed `membership_id`) — **never a stored counter.**
- Limits / exhausted packs are **warn-with-override at check-in** (`AttendanceOverrideDialog`, both check-in paths) — **never a hard block.**
- Both paths (`check-in-view.tsx`, member-sheet `checkIn()`) fresh-count the plan's usage window and open the override dialog at the limit / on an exhausted pack. Usage lines ("9/12 this month" / "7 of 10 sessions left") render in check-in row meta + the sheet's Attendance section.
- The Attendance register has one search field for member name or Member ID. Staff select the matching row and use its existing check-in/check-out action, which keeps the normal limit/override flow and avoids a separate ID-specific action. Member ID remains an identifier, never a self-service PIN.

---

## UPI AutoPay (`059`, `060`) — see `PRDs/upi_autopay.md`

India-first recurring auto-debit, built as an **opt-in layer over the manual ledger**. Gateway = **Razorpay Subscriptions** (it owns the RBI eMandate + 24h pre-debit notice). **Auto and manual collection share ONE ledger**: an auto charge still lands in `payments` and settles a `membership_periods` invoice, so dues/invoices/`fee_status`/reports are mode-agnostic.

Each gym connects its **own** Razorpay account (creds in `account_payment_credentials`, admin-only, deliberately kept OFF `accounts` so a webhook secret can't leak to a member SELECT) — money flows member → gym's Razorpay → gym's bank. **UsefulDesk never touches it.**

**Tables:** `payment_mandates` (one live mandate per membership — `UNIQUE(membership_id) WHERE status='active'`) · `webhook_events` (idempotency + audit; RLS-on/no-policy = **service-role only**) · `account_payment_credentials`.

**⚠️ The service-role bypass.** A webhook runs as service-role with no `auth.uid()`, so gateway inserts go through SECURITY DEFINER `record_gateway_payment` / `record_gateway_charge`, which set the tx-local GUC `app.system_payment='1'`. `validate_membership_payment` then skips **only the agent check** — every financial guard (open period, amount > 0, ≤ balance) still runs. Same GUC-bypass shape as `058`'s `app.allow_payment_restamp`. All gateway RPCs are revoked from clients and granted to `service_role`.

**Lifecycle RPCs:** `activate_mandate` / `revoke_mandate` (both flip `collection_mode`).

**Code:** `src/lib/payments/razorpay.ts` (server-only REST client, no SDK dep, per-gym Basic auth — `createPlan`/`createSubscription`/`cancelSubscription`, `verifyWebhookSignature` HMAC-SHA256, `toPaise`/`toRupees`, `mandateStatusFromSubscription`) · `src/lib/payments/credentials.ts` (secret isolated to `getRazorpayCredentials`) · predicates `canManageMandates` (agent+) / `canConfigurePaymentGateway` (admin).

**Routes:**
- `POST /api/payments/razorpay/mandate` (agent-gated) — load membership+plan → create Razorpay plan+subscription with `{account_id, membership_id, contact_id}` in `notes` → park a pending `payment_mandates` row → return `short_url` for the UPI-mandate QR. Monthly/quarterly cadences only; derives cadence from the pricing option (month×1/×3, week×4/×12|13, day-range snap for backfilled day-unit options); **rejects non-recurring plans**; mandates authorise `option.price` (not the setup-fee-inflated first `fee_amount`).
- `POST /api/payments/razorpay/webhook/[accountId]` — per-gym URL carries the account id → look up THAT gym's secret → HMAC verify → dedupe on `x-razorpay-event-id` in `webhook_events` → route: `subscription.authenticated` → `activate_mandate`; `subscription.charged` → **`record_gateway_charge`**; `halted`/`pending` → revoke-failed; `cancelled`/`completed`/`expired` → revoke. **Always returns 200** so Razorpay won't retry-storm.

**⚠️ Webhook account guard.** The route cross-checks the subscription's `notes.account_id` against the URL's `[accountId]` and throws on mismatch (recorded as `payload._error`; `processed_at` stays NULL). Pasting *another* UsefulDesk account's webhook URL into Razorpay used to no-op silently — same Razorpay secret on both accounts → signature passes, the mandate lookup (scoped to the wrong account) misses, the event still gets marked processed. This bit us: mandates stuck "pending approval" after real approval. A missing mandate on activate also throws now.
**Reconcile query:** `webhook_events WHERE processed_at IS NULL`. Recover by calling the gateway RPCs with the payload ids under the CORRECT account, then stamp `processed_at`.

**Auto-renew on charge (`060`):** `record_gateway_charge` — the first charge settles the current cycle; every later charge **opens the next period + rolls the membership `start_date`/`end_date` forward + settles it**, all one transaction, idempotent on `gateway_payment_id`. Guards `plan_type='recurring'`, rolls by the option's calendar interval, bills `option.price`, and rolls the pointer's `fee_amount` — **so a custom-negotiated fee resets at auto-renewal.**

**Dunning fallback:** the renewal cron filters `.eq('collection_mode','manual')` — a healthy auto member is skipped (their mandate collects; nagging = double-contact). A member whose mandate DIED is already flipped back to `'manual'` by `revoke_mandate`, so they fall through to the normal WhatsApp reminder. An un-approved `pending` mandate also stays `'manual'`, so it's still chased. The manual "Remind" button is always allowed.

**UI:** the member sheet's **Billing** section header carries "Set up auto-pay" (gated `canSetupAutoPay` = `canManageMandates` + active + non-trial + recurring plan + no live mandate) → `SetUpAutoPayDialog` posts to the mandate route and shows the `short_url`. The Billing card body shows "Auto-pay on · <vpa>" / "pending approval". Settings → Payments & currency has an admin-gated, INR-only "Auto-pay (Razorpay)" card (write-mostly — a blank secret field preserves the stored value) + the per-gym webhook URL to copy. `InvoiceDetailDialog` shows an "Auto" `Badge` next to a `source='auto'` payment's method.

**RBI:** ≤₹15k/txn = no per-charge AFA (covers most gym plans); the first charge needs AFA (gateway handles).
**Gotcha:** Razorpay's Subscriptions/Recurring product must be **ACTIVATED** on the account (even in test mode) — `/plans` and `/subscriptions` 401 until then, while basic `/orders` works.

**Still open (optional):** richer `payment.failed` handling (an immediate "auto-pay failed, pay manually" nudge instead of waiting for `subscription.halted`); one-click "Connect Razorpay" via OAuth / embedded onboarding to replace the key-paste settings card (additive swap — the creds surface is already abstracted; plan in the PRD).

## RPC gotcha — adding a param

`renew_membership_transaction` / `edit_membership_cycle` / `change_membership_plan` gained a trailing `p_pricing_option_id UUID DEFAULT NULL` in `062`. **Adding a param needs `DROP FUNCTION` by exact old identity first** — `CREATE OR REPLACE` leaves a PostgREST **HTTP 300 overload**. Re-apply GRANTs after.
